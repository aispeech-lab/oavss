## Overview
This is the pytorch implementation of our paper: "Online Audio-Visual Speech Separation with Generative Adversarial Training". In this work, we propose the **causal audio-visual speech separation model** and **streaming inference strategy**, which make our model do online audio-visual speech separation. Besides, **generative adversarial training** is adopted in our model to reduce the effects of SI-SNR, which can reduce the word error rate (WER) of separated audio on public automatic speech recognition (ASR) system (e.g., Baidu ASR and Yitu ASR).

We will release code soon. If you have any question about implementation details, feel free to ask me (zhangpeng2018@ia.ac.cn)
