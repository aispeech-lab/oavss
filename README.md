## Overview
This is the pytorch implementation of our paper:"Online Audio-Visual Speech Separation with Generative Adversarial Training". In this work, we propose the causal audio-visual speech separation model and streaming inference strategy, which make our model do online audio-visual speech separation. Besides, generative adversarial training is adopted to reduce the effects of SI-SNR, which can reduce the word error rate (WER) of separated audio on public automatic speech recognition (ASR) system (e.g., Baidu ASR and Yitu ASR).
